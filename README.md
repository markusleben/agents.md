# AGENTS.md

Agent protocol rules for Codex/Cursor (inspired by @steipete).

## What is AGENTS.md?

`AGENTS.md` defines workspace rules, git workflows, and agent behavior guidelines for AI coding assistants in Codex/Cursor.

## Usage

If `AGENTS.md` doesn't exist in your workspace, clone it:

```bash
curl -o AGENTS.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robinebers/agents.md/main/AGENTS.md
```

Codex/Cursor will automatically read `AGENTS.md` from your workspace root and apply the rules to agent interactions.
